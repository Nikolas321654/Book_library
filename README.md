# Book_library

This is my first project on .NET â€” a simple console-based book library.  
The application is still in progress.

**To start app:**

- Instal .NET on your PC
- Clone the Repository: Open your terminal or command prompt and run:  
  `git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/Book_library.git`
- Navigate to the Project Directory: `cd Book_library`
- Run the Application `dotnet run`
